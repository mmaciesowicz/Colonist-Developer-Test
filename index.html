  Code Thought Process

  To get the checker board layout, I created a 2x2 grid using CSS "display: grid" on the container and positioned the first
  button in the first box as well as the second button in the 4th box.

  For the title font, I cropped an image of the sample button and inserted it into a tool called "WhatTheFont" (https://www.myfonts.com/pages/whatthefont)
  From there, I was able to find a similar looking font called "Xavier Sans Bold". Following that I searched for similar fonts the this one and found the Wicked Mouse font.

  To ensure the buttons are the same size, I made the heights of the rows to be the same, then used flexbox
  to center the contents in the middle of each button.

  The right button when clicked will call some API function: getAPIResult() while the left button will redirect the user
  to a colonist room URL with a random 4 character room code.

  Using Dev Tools on the colonist.io lobby site, I was able to locate API calls to 'https://colonist.io/api/game-list'. From there, using a CORS Changer extension, I sent an API 
  request and returned the data. Since these buttons are to be tested on colonist with only button functionality, the data is just displayed into the console for future use.

  For a unique effect to add to this product, I added a text spreading effect on hover! I believe this makes the button look more inviting to click and lets the user know that
  the button is clickable. The issue with spreading the font is that this expands the container divs and sometimes would make the second word jump to a new line. To try to resolve this 
  edge case, I calculated how much excess space is needed to spread the text, then using the button width I determined if the spread will go to a new line or not. If it will go 
  to a new line, I disabled the text-spread effect, but the user will still know that they are hovering due to the border and drop-shadow effects. For symmetry purposes, I believe it was best 
  that either both buttons had the letter-spacing effect or neither, so if one was unable to space with skipping lines, the other one got disabled too. 

  Time to complete: ~12 hours (includes searching web for fonts/api links, debugging and testing)
