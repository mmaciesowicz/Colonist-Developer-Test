  Code Thought Process

  To get the checker board layout, I created a 2x2 grid using CSS "display: grid" on the container and positioned the first
  button in the first box as well as the second button in the 4th box.

  For the title font, I browsed dafont.com (https://www.dafont.com/cute-dino-2.font?fpp=200&text=QUICK+PLAY) until I found a similar looking font to that of the design screenshot, as I was
  unable to find the font in the dev tools of the colonist.io website since it appears to be an older design.
  Note: font not rendering in jsfiddle.

  I used a colour picker on the screenshots of the buttons to find the top and bottom colours of the buttons and made the
  backgrounds a linear gradient with each of the respective colours.

  To ensure the buttons are the same size, I made the heights of the rows to be the same, then used flexbox
  to center the contents in the middle of each button.

  The right button when clicked will call some API function: getAPIResult() while the left button will redirect the user
  to a colonist room URL with a random 4 character room code.

  Time to complete: ~4-4.5 hours.
